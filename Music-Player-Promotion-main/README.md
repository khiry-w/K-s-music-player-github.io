### GitHub: Music Player Repository
- Big Greeen Buttons
- GitHub: create a repository and include ```github.io```
- Settings / Pages / Branch / ```None``` to ```Main``` / Press ```SAVE```
- Introduce computer instructions (must scan the screen for specific words with implied "click")
- Settings / Pages / Will see Webpage URL (not local)
